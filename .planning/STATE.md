# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-14)

**Core value:** The phone's thermal state, always visible at a glance — with an alert before it gets dangerously hot.
**Current focus:** Phase 08 — dashboard-tabs

## Current Position

Phase: 08
Plan: Not started
Status: v1.2 milestone complete
Last activity: 2026-05-15

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 16 (v1.0: 6, v1.1: 2)
- Average duration: not tracked pre-v1.2
- Total execution time: not tracked pre-v1.2

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.2]: CPU-02 and MEM-02 are experimental — Mach system APIs (host_statistics, host_statistics64) may be blocked by iOS 18 sandbox. Phase 6 validates on device before UI work.
- [v1.2]: Dashboard uses TabView (user choice), not ScrollView. Three tabs: Thermal, CPU, Memory.
- [v1.2]: No battery features this milestone — deferred to v1.3+.
- [Phase 08-dashboard-tabs]: Tab selection integers follow Phase 7 order: 0=Thermal, 1=CPU, 2=Memory; .tag() after .tabItem{} per SwiftUI convention
- [Phase 08]: SC5 confirmed passing on physical iOS 18 device — tab switching does not reset metric values, no regressions
- [v1.2]: DASH-01 and DASH-02 were satisfied in Phase 7 (SC4), not Phase 8. Phase 8 only added selectedTab binding (SC5) and closed out docs.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 6 must run on physical device — Simulator cannot reproduce iOS 18 sandbox restrictions on Mach APIs.
